# Vanilla Node Server
---------------------
### A simple Node.js web server written without any frameworks.

**Why?**

I thought this belonged on github to show others how to build a simple Node.js web site from scratch without needing to learn Express or HapiJS. I think it's valuable to understand some of the lower level features of Node.js that a framework might hide from you.

**How**

I plan to take you step by step through how I went from nothing to a working web site using minimal tooling. I'll do my best to explain eveything along the way.
